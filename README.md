# Project Title

Learn how to implement deeplearning to recognize or learn something based on your project using numpy, tensorflow, PIL or OpenCV

## Getting Started linear_regretioin_and_gradient_descent.py

To run linear_regretioin_and_gradient_descent.py you need picture X and O to learn and testing purposes. the input is the number of images with X and O and the result is prediction by computer using the number, when the result after training approaching 0 then the result is X otherwise, when the result after training approaching 1 then the result is O. It depends how you design your network. in my case approaching 0 is X, approaching 1 is 0.

### Prerequisites

You can download the X or O images here :
* [Images](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m73b071vb17y30g/AADFlXo0YVfFMSH_9xYmQSmKa?dl=0) - The Images

### How to Use

Then you need change the images directory based on where you save the images in loadImage() method
